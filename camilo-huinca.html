        <section class="biografia"><h3>Camillo Huinca's work is rich with color, content and a brightly
illustrated narrative that speaks for itself.</h3>

<h3>Born and raised in Santiago in Chile, Camilo has divided his career
between graphic design and painting. Working independently has
allowed Camilo to “develop (his) own style, having a main focus on
the use of curiosity”, he explains.</h3>

<h3>In 2014 Camilo set up Perfe Studio, focusing on graphic design
projects in “a more commercial way”. Within illustration, he described
his main motivation as, “to be able to generate a communication
method based on simplicity and synthesis, with few tools and colors.
I am interested in identifying people's behaviour, portraying activities,
intimate moments, body gestures, disfiguring objects and reducing
the amount of detail in a composition.” Camilo is fascinated by
everyday scenes, moments and personal habits, often depicting
scenic bus routes, art galleries and public figures in his own
psychedelically shaped style. “Within my work I try to reproduce real
moments from an innocent and impartial perspective.”</h3></section>
