        <section class="biografia"><h3>La Boca has the rare, impressive ability to create artwork and
            designs resembling some of the best album sleeves lurking in your
            dad's record collection.</h3>
            
        <h3>The studio, founded in 2002, is based in west London and has
            gathered an envious collection of awards, including Cannes Lions,
            European Design Awards, and the AOI Illustration Awards. Their
            exquisitely executed, psychedelic style is the combined result of each
            of the studio's members' unique influences, having hailed from
            London, Bordeaux, Devon and Switzerland.
            “We work as a studio, so most of our designs are created as a team,”
            says Scott Bendall of La Boca. “It's not unusual to have two or three
            people working on a single piece.”</h3>
            
         <h3>Keen to work on more animated projects in the future, the team
            (based in two studios, one in London and one in Amsterdam) are
            never short on work from a selection of devoted clients. In their own
            words, La Boca's creations are: “Retina teasing, tactile and
            occasionally slightly wonky.”</h3></section>
