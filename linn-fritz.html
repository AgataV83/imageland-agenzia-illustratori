        <h3>Swedish illustrator designer and animator, Linn Fritz lives and works
            in London where she creates charmingly clean, precise imagery in a
            trademark pastel palette for a wide range of editorial and
            commercial clients. Her neat, fluid line work was honed during her
            time at Hyper Island, a time which Linn cites as “hands down one of
            the best experiences” of her life.
            “My Hyper Island journey completely changed me as a person.”
            she says, “It pushed me to work harder and gave me the tools to
            succeed in the real world.”</h3>
            
        <h3>The progressive nature of Hyper Island led Linn to abandon pen and
            paper and concentrate on what digital could offer her already
            well-honed drawings. As she puts it, “There's more freedom drawing
            digitally, and more room for mistakes.” Alongside her editorial and
            commercial projects, Linn is the co-founder of Panimation, “a
            community of equality-driven women, trans and non-binary friends
            aiming to connect and support each other within the animation
            industry.”
            Some of her favorite projects often orbit around her interests of
            “feminism, clothes, plants and interior” but Linn also looks for a good
            client relationship, one with trust and creative freedom.</h3>
